    <p> World hunger has been an ongoing prevalent issue globally for centuries. Many people struggle to survive due to a lack of food and water. In 2023, the number of people affected by world hunger has increased to 333 million people. Conflict only rises that number, with areas affected by war and violence containing 70% of the world's hungry people. Additionally, food as well as global fertilizer prices have increased substantially, especially over these past few years. As these prices rise, food insecurity will increase. </p>
